pytest tests/tasks/ -v

# Run specific task verification
pytest tests/tasks/test_task007_verification.py -v

# Run all verification tests
pytest tests/tasks/ -k "verification" -v

## Priority Guidelines

**Critical**: Core ETL pipeline reliability, data integrity, multi-database coordination, system stability
**High**: AST processing accuracy, plugin system extensibility, performance optimization, error handling robustness
**Medium**: Advanced enrichment features, monitoring enhancements, additional database backends, analytics capabilities

### 2.3 Sprint/Iteration Planning for Development Tasks

- Store all development tasks in `docs/tasks/` directory
- Maintain master task list in `docs/tasks/TASK-LIST.md` with comprehensive tracking table
- Individual task files stored as `docs/tasks/TASK-[ID]-[brief-name].md`
- Include ETL-focused elements:
  - **Task Tracking:** Complete table with status, priority, assignee, dates, effort, dependencies
  - **Component Mapping:** Clear association with ETL pipeline stages and architecture layers
  - **Progress Monitoring:** Real-time status updates and completion tracking
  - **Integration Dependencies:** Task dependencies and pipeline stage coordination
  - **Performance Tracking:** Throughput, data quality, and reliability metrics monitoring


âœ¨ **Ready to transform AST processing requirements into actionable development tasks!** Share your ETL pipeline goals, and I'll create comprehensive, research-backed tasks that leverage the Snake-Pipe's modular architecture and plugin system.

- Maintain clear traceability between business needs and development tasks for AST processing and multi-database coordination capabilities
- Consider technical constraints of high-throughput ETL processing, multi-backend coordination, and real-time file monitoring in development planning
- Ensure alignment with clean architecture, plugin patterns, and ETL pipeline principles for development task organization
- All deliverables must support the goal of reliable AST data processing and multi-database storage through development implementation
- Implement comprehensive development task tracking for ETL pipeline development with performance and reliability focus
- Focus on stakeholder value creation through development of improved AST processing, data transformation, and code analysis features

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REMINDER**: No implementation is complete without:
1. **MANDATORY CODING PRINCIPLES & DESIGN PATTERNS** - All SOLID principles, clean architecture patterns, plugin system design, and ETL-specific patterns applied
2. **MARKING EVERYTHING AS DONE** - Every task, requirement, feature, and pattern implementation marked "COMPLETED" immediately
3. **Real-time status tracking** - update status during work, not after
4. **90% test coverage** and comprehensive documentation updates (ETL pipelines require extensive integration testing)
5. **Pattern Implementation Tracking** - Each design pattern marked as DONE with proper format
6. **Performance Standards** - Meet processing throughput (10,000+ files/min), data quality (99.9%), and reliability (99.5% uptime) requirements

### Essential Commands for Verification

```

### Coverage Exception Documentation

If 90% coverage cannot be achieved for ETL components, document exceptions with:
- **File/Function**: Specific uncovered code (database connection handling, external service integrations)
- **Justification**: Why coverage is not feasible (external database dependencies, file system operations, network conditions)
- **Alternative Verification**: How the code quality is ensured without tests (integration testing, manual verification, monitoring)
- **Future Plan**: Timeline and approach for achieving full coverage with test databases and mock services
