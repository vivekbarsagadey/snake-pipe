2. **Data Integration Specialists (35%)**: Require high-performance XML-to-JSON conversion tools for ETL pipelines and data transformation projects
3. **XML Tool Users (25%)**: Need command-line XML parsing utilities for file analysis, validation, and format conversion tasks

## Task Creation Framework

### Research Requirements (Before Task Creation)

1. **XML Processing Analysis**: Research common XML parsing challenges, performance optimization techniques, and error handling patterns
2. **Technical Feasibility**: Investigate lxml performance characteristics, JSON formatting options, and CLI design best practices
3. **Codebase Analysis**: Map existing parser architecture, identify optimization opportunities, and assess integration points

- **Story Tasks**: Single independent features (e.g., new output formatter, CLI option support)
- **Technical Tasks**: Specific implementation work (e.g., optimize parser performance, enhance error messages)

### Task Organization

**Task Location**: All tasks must be created in the `docs/tasks/` directory with the naming convention:

- `docs/tasks/TASK-001-feature-name.md` (for individual features)
- `docs/tasks/TASK-002-bug-fix-name.md` (for bug fixes)
- `docs/tasks/EPIC-001-major-feature.md` (for multi-task epics)

**Task Numbering**: Use sequential numbering starting from 001, with separate sequences for TASKs and EPICs.

**File Creation**: When creating tasks, always use the `create_file` tool to create the markdown file in the correct `docs/tasks/` directory.

**Task List Management**: Every new task MUST be added to the `docs/tasks/TASK-LIST.md` master table with:
- Unique Task ID
- Clear title and status (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´âšªðŸ”µâš«)
- Priority level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Assignee and dates
- Effort estimation and dependencies
- Component/parser stage mapping

**Task Test Organization**: Each task MUST have corresponding test files in `tests/tasks/` directory:
- `tests/tasks/test_task[XXX]_verification.py` - Verification tests that validate task implementation
- `tests/tasks/test_task[XXX]_integration.py` - Integration tests for task components
- `tests/tasks/test_task[XXX]_[feature].py` - Feature-specific tests when needed

**Task Test Execution**: Tests can be run to verify task completion:
```bash
# Run all task tests
pytest tests/tasks/ -v

# Run specific task verification
pytest tests/tasks/test_task007_verification.py -v

# Run all verification tests
pytest tests/tasks/ -k "verification" -v
```

from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from app.core.services.parser_service import JavaParserService

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1/parse", tags=["parsing"])

@router.post("/java", response_model=ParseResponse)
async def parse_java_file(
    request: ParseRequest,
    parser_service: JavaParserService = Depends()
) -> ParseResponse:

- [ ] Documentation updated including CLI help, usage examples, and developer guides
- [ ] No regression in existing XML parsing functionality or performance benchmarks

## Priority Guidelines

**High**: Core parsing accuracy, lxml integration quality, AST construction correctness, CLI usability
**Medium**: Advanced parsing features, optimization capabilities, additional output format support
**Low**: Edge cases, analytics features, advanced validation, integration with external tools

**Focus**: Create research-informed, immediately actionable tasks that leverage the existing modular architecture, Abstract Factory and Strategy patterns, and XML processing pipeline. Each task should enable developers to extend the XML parsing capabilities while maintaining the established patterns, performance targets, and code quality standards.

âœ¨ **Ready to transform ideas into code!** Share your development goals, and I'll create comprehensive, research-backed tasks that leverage the XML Parser's modular architecture and design patterns.
- Maintain clear traceability between business needs and development tasks for XML processing capabilities
- Consider technical constraints of lxml parsing, JSON formatting, and CLI interface design in development planning
- Ensure alignment with Abstract Factory and Strategy principles for development task organization
- All deliverables must support the goal of reliable XML-to-JSON conversion through development implementation
- Implement comprehensive development task tracking for XML processing pipeline development
- Focus on stakeholder value creation through development of improved XML processing and data transformation features

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REMINDER**: No implementation is complete without:
1. **MANDATORY CODING PRINCIPLES & DESIGN PATTERNS** - All SOLID principles, Python design patterns, and project-specific patterns applied
2. **MARKING EVERYTHING AS DONE** - Every task, requirement, feature, and pattern implementation marked "COMPLETED" immediately
3. **Real-time status tracking** - update status during work, not after
4. **98% test coverage** and comprehensive documentation updates
5. **Pattern Implementation Tracking** - Each design pattern marked as DONE with proper format
6. **Code Quality Standards** - KISS, YAGNI, DRY, and all other principles strictly enforced

### Essential Commands for Verification

```bash
# Test Coverage Verification (MANDATORY)
pytest tests/ -v --cov=app --cov-fail-under=98 --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Code Quality Verification
black app/ tests/ --line-length 200 --check
ruff check app/ tests/
mypy app/

# Full Lint and Fix
ruff check --fix app/ tests/
black app/ tests/ --line-length 200

# Run Specific Test Categories
pytest tests/unit/ -v          # Unit tests only
pytest tests/integration/ -v   # Integration tests only
pytest tests/e2e/ -v          # End-to-end tests only
```

### Coverage Exception Documentation

If 98% coverage cannot be achieved, document exceptions with:
- **File/Function**: Specific uncovered code
- **Justification**: Why coverage is not feasible (external dependencies, error conditions, etc.)
- **Alternative Verification**: How the code quality is ensured without tests
- **Future Plan**: Timeline and approach for achieving full coverage
