# EPIC-002: AST Processing Transform Phase Implementation

## Research Summary

**Key Findings**: 
- AST JSON schemas vary significantly across languages but share common structural patterns (nodes, children, attributes)
- Cross-language normalization requires sophisticated mapping of language-specific constructs to universal representations
- Dependency analysis across files enables advanced code intelligence features (call graphs, impact analysis, refactoring support)
- Data quality issues in AST parsing (incomplete trees, parser errors) require quarantine and recovery mechanisms
- Enrichment algorithms can extract semantic relationships not explicit in original parser output

**Technical Analysis**: 
- Pydantic validation provides high-performance schema validation with detailed error reporting
- Graph algorithms (DFS, topological sort) essential for dependency resolution and cycle detection
- Memory-efficient processing required for codebases with millions of cross-references
- Probabilistic deduplication algorithms handle near-duplicate code patterns and refactored code
- Real-time incremental processing enables continuous code analysis workflows

**Architecture Impact**: 
- Transform phase represents core value-add of the pipeline through data enrichment and standardization
- Clean interfaces between validation, normalization, and enrichment enable independent optimization
- Plugin architecture supports language-specific transformation strategies
- Error handling and quarantine systems prevent data quality issues from propagating downstream

**Risk Assessment**: 
- Complex cross-file relationship algorithms may have performance bottlenecks
- Schema evolution management as language parsers update their output formats
- Memory usage optimization for processing large interconnected codebases
- Data consistency maintenance during incremental updates and parallel processing

## Business Context

**User Problem**: Software architects and development teams need consistent, enriched code analysis data that standardizes AST representations across multiple programming languages while discovering hidden relationships and dependencies not apparent from individual file analysis.

**Business Value**: 
- 80% improvement in code analysis accuracy through cross-file relationship discovery
- Universal code representation enabling polyglot codebase analysis and insights
- Real-time data quality assurance preventing downstream analysis errors
- Advanced code intelligence features enabling architectural decision support and technical debt analysis

**User Persona**: Software Architects (40%) - need comprehensive code relationships and architectural insights; Data Engineers (35%) - require reliable data transformation and quality; Development Teams (25%) - benefit from enhanced code understanding

**Success Metric**: 
- 99.9% schema validation success rate across all supported languages
- Process cross-file relationships for codebases with 1,000,000+ files
- <200ms average processing time per AST file including enrichment
- Zero data corruption through comprehensive validation and error handling

## User Story

As a **software architect**, I want comprehensive AST data transformation and enrichment so that I can analyze code relationships, dependencies, and patterns across multiple programming languages with consistent, high-quality data that reveals architectural insights not visible from individual files.

### Code Patterns

```python
# Language-Specific Validation Strategy Pattern
class SchemaValidatorFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_validator(language: str, config: ValidationConfig) -> ASTValidator:
        validator_map = {
            "python": PythonASTValidator(config),
            "java": JavaASTValidator(config),
            "javascript": JavaScriptASTValidator(config),
            "typescript": TypeScriptASTValidator(config)
        }
        return validator_map.get(language, GenericASTValidator(config))

# Pipeline Pattern for Multi-Stage Transformation
class TransformationPipeline:
    def __init__(self, config: TransformConfig):
        self.stages = [
            ValidationStage(config.validation),
            NormalizationStage(config.normalization),
            EnrichmentStage(config.enrichment),
            DeduplicationStage(config.deduplication)
        ]
    
    async def process(self, ast_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> TransformResult:
        current_data = ast_data
        results = []
        
        for stage in self.stages:
            result = await stage.process(current_data)
            results.append(result)
            current_data = result.output_data
            
            if result.has_errors and stage.is_critical:
                return TransformResult.failure(results)
        
        return TransformResult.success(current_data, results)

# Graph-Based Relationship Discovery Pattern
class DependencyAnalyzer:
    async def build_relationship_graph(self, ast_files: List[NormalizedAST]) -> RelationshipGraph:
        graph = RelationshipGraph()
        
        # Build nodes
        for ast in ast_files:
            node = graph.add_node(ast.file_path, ast.metadata)
        
        # Discover relationships using multiple strategies
        for strategy in self.relationship_strategies:
            relationships = await strategy.discover_relationships(ast_files)
            for rel in relationships:
                graph.add_edge(rel.source, rel.target, rel.relationship_type, rel.metadata)
        
        # Validate and enrich graph
        await self._validate_graph_consistency(graph)
        await self._enrich_indirect_relationships(graph)
        
        return graph
```
