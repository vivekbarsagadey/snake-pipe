# Task 003: Batch Processing Engine Implementation

## Research Summary

**Key Findings**: 
- Batch processing is essential for initial large-scale AST file ingestion during system initialization
- Memory-efficient batch processing can handle 10,000+ files per minute using streaming techniques
- Queue-based batch management enables prioritization by file size, language, or modification time
- Parallel batch processing across multiple workers dramatically improves throughput
- Integration with file discovery (TASK-001) and real-time watcher (TASK-002) enables hybrid processing modes

**Technical Analysis**: 
- Async batch processing with configurable batch sizes (50-500 files per batch)
- Worker pool pattern for parallel batch execution across CPU cores
- Memory streaming to avoid loading large batches entirely into memory
- Progress tracking and resumable batch processing for large repositories
- Error isolation to prevent single file failures from stopping entire batches

**Architecture Impact**: 
- Enables high-throughput initial data ingestion complementing real-time processing
- Provides foundation for scheduled bulk processing and repository re-analysis
- Clean interface separation between batch coordination and individual file processing
- Plugin-compatible design for custom batch processing strategies

**Risk Assessment**: 
- **Memory Risk**: Large batches may cause memory pressure - mitigated by streaming and configurable batch sizes
- **Performance Risk**: Inefficient batching can bottleneck entire pipeline - addressed with adaptive batch sizing
- **Error Risk**: Batch failures may lose significant work - handled with checkpointing and resumable processing

## Business Context
