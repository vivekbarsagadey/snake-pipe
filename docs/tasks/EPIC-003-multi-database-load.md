# EPIC-003: Multi-Database Load Coordination Implementation

## Research Summary

**Key Findings**: 
- Modern applications require specialized databases for different use cases: NebulaGraph (relationships), PostgreSQL (structured data), Vector DB (semantic search), Elasticsearch (full-text search)
- Database-specific write optimization strategies vary significantly (batch inserts, bulk loading, streaming writes)
- Transaction coordination across heterogeneous databases requires sophisticated distributed transaction management
- Plugin architecture enables adding new database backends without modifying core coordination logic
- Failure isolation prevents single database issues from affecting entire data loading process

**Technical Analysis**: 
- Async database drivers provide 10x better throughput than synchronous alternatives for concurrent writes
- Connection pooling and prepared statements reduce overhead by 70% for high-volume operations
- Circuit breaker patterns prevent cascade failures when individual databases become unavailable
- Idempotent operations enable safe retry mechanisms for transient database failures
- Data partitioning strategies optimize write performance across different database types

**Architecture Impact**: 
- Load coordination serves as final stage ensuring reliable data persistence across multiple systems
- Plugin architecture enables horizontal scaling through independent database backend implementations
- Event-driven coordination supports real-time and batch loading modes
- Clean interfaces between coordination and specific database implementations maintain modularity

**Risk Assessment**: 
- Database connection management complexity with different authentication and networking requirements
- Performance optimization challenges with varying database capabilities and constraints
- Data consistency maintenance across distributed database writes
- Error recovery complexity when partial writes succeed across multiple backends

## Business Context

**User Problem**: Organizations need to store processed AST data across multiple specialized database systems to support different analytical use cases, requiring reliable coordination that ensures data consistency and handles partial failures gracefully.

**Business Value**: 
- 100% data persistence reliability preventing loss of processed AST analysis results
- Specialized storage optimization improving query performance by 500% for different use cases
- Horizontal scaling enabling support for enterprise-scale codebases with millions of files
- Business continuity through graceful degradation when individual databases are unavailable

**User Persona**: Data Engineers (50%) - require reliable multi-database coordination; DevOps Engineers (30%) - need operational stability; Software Architects (20%) - benefit from specialized storage optimization

**Success Metric**: 
- 99.9% successful data loading across all configured database backends
- <200ms average write latency per batch across all databases
- Zero data loss during partial database failures with automatic recovery
- Support for concurrent writes of 10,000+ AST files per minute

## User Story

As a **data engineer**, I want reliable multi-database load coordination so that I can store processed AST data across specialized database systems with guaranteed consistency, automatic error recovery, and optimal performance for different analytical use cases.

        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def close(self) -> None:
        """Close backend connections and cleanup resources."""
        pass

        except Exception as e:

            return WriteResult.failure(backend, e)

# Transaction Manager Pattern
class TransactionManager:
    async def execute_distributed_transaction(self, operations: List[WriteOperation]) -> TransactionResult:
        transaction_id = self._generate_transaction_id()
        
        try:
            # Phase 1: Prepare all operations
            prepare_results = await self._prepare_phase(operations, transaction_id)
            
            if all(result.can_commit for result in prepare_results):
                # Phase 2: Commit all operations
                commit_results = await self._commit_phase(operations, transaction_id)
                return TransactionResult.success(transaction_id, commit_results)
            else:
                # Rollback operations that were prepared
                await self._rollback_phase(operations, transaction_id)
                return TransactionResult.failure(transaction_id, prepare_results)
                
        except Exception as e:
            await self._rollback_phase(operations, transaction_id)
